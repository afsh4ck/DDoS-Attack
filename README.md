Dont use this program against online websites without the consent of the admin.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based educational project that simulates a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack for the purpose of understanding network concepts, programming, and security implications. Please note that this project is intended purely for educational and ethical purposes, aiming to provide insights into how DDoS attacks work.

## Key Features

- Controlled DDoS attack using Python
- Utilize standard networking libraries for packet generation
- Display a progress bar with percentage during the attack
- The program exponentially increases the number of requests, increasing the effectiveness of the attack

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/afsh4ck/DDos-Attack
cd Ddos-Attack
sudo chmod 777 ddos.py
python ddos.py
```
